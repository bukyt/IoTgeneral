# Module 5 Contract

Student Names: Joonas Tiitson, Kennar Kahju

## Agreement:
As students in this class, we agree to present our skills in using and understanding IoTempower.

We will first learn a bit about IoTempower framework. Then use the learned skills to make a remote device deployable from the comfort of our own computer, allowing us to change the function of the device remotely.
