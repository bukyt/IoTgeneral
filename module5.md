## Module 5 Contract

**Student Names:** Kennar Kahju, Joonas Tiitson

**Agreement:**

As students in this class, we agree to present our skills in using and understanding IoTempower

**Tasks:**

* Talking about framework benefits: useful features, 
* We will show the basics of remote deployment, how to set it up with IoTEmpower and how to update devices over the air(OTA).
* We are designing a home security system with access control. It would feature:
    * RFID card access
    * a "main door"
    * sound signals for false entry
    * LED signal for having an open door
    * remote opening of the "door" using another microcontroller
    * ability to disable all opening of doors (security feature)
    * A dashboard featuring current lock status, ability to open door


## Results

Framework benefits: 
* There is less to be done from scratch, writing code is simplified by the use of simple modules
* Usually frameworks are more stable than self-built systems and can survive small code changes more easily
* Frameworks have the ability to quickly deploy changes, reducing time cost
* In the context of IoTEmpower, devices can be updated wirelessly, further reducing time cost and making updates faster
* Also, IoTEmpower allows setting up devices using only one line (everything else is included in the package)

Remote deployment:
IoTEmpower has a simple interface to set up devices. First flash needs to be over USB, and after that every flash can be done over WiFi, reducing the need for wires.


Security system:
Final functions:
* RFID card access with selected cards
* remote control to open lock and monitor latest activity
* sounds for allowed/denied entry
* LED for showing an open door
* Dashboard for opening lock remotely, viewing last time lock was opened and disabling card access

Pictures and videos will be added
