## Module 4 Contract

**Student Names:** Kennar Kahju, Joonas Tiitson

**Agreement:**

As students in this class, we agree to present our skills in using and understanding publish/subscribe with a focus on MQTT, IoT testing (simulators), and integration with MQTT and Node-RED. We will demonstrate our capabilities in the following ways:

**Tasks (As a story):**

For MQTT, we are showing communication between devices in different rooms.
We plan to design a home device (air conditioner) as an LED (on/off light) on a microcontroller and temperature sensors. For testing the device we use a MQTT simulator. 
We will design a Discord bot using Node-Red to report us the temperature on command (through us writing in a channel) or do some other task.
