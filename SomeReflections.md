Self reflections:  
Learned the world of IOT.  
Got physical experience with micro controllers and connecting them into one whole network.  
Got introduction to NodeRED and the different applications of using it.
Using contracts we got used to a more systematic approach to documenting progress and results.  
We got a solid introduction and great practical experience for setting up our own IOT solutions in the future.
